<h1> House price prediction </h1>

<p> Lagos, Africa's most populated city is home to over one million houses currently occupied. However, there seems to be at least half a million houses up for sale. </p>

<p> Most times, people's choice of house location is based on the price of the house. This project aims to provide a means to predict house price per location.  </p>
